        <h2>About Me</h2>

Before transitioning to programming, I served as a math professor, sharing my love for mathematics with countless students and inspiring many to pursue their own academic journeys.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have taken on various roles that bridge the gap between mathematics and technology, continuously seeking to innovate and contribute to the field.</p>
